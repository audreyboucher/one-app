# One App

The idea is to create a productivity app for Android and iOS that's free, open sourced and which allows to organise routines and tasks as easy and customizable as possible.
Productivity apps in my opinion are usually expensive, non user-friendly, lack features or all of the above. I have yet to find one that suits my needs and expectations so I'm basically creating the productivity app I've always been looking for. Hopefully it'll be apealing to other people as well.
